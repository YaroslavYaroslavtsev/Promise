# Promise

The library provides an implementation of promises for Electric Imp/Squirrel.

According to Wikipedia: “Futures and promises originated in functional programming and related paradigms (such as logic programming) to decouple a value (a future) from how it was computed (a promise), allowing the computation to be done more flexibly, notably by parallelizing it.”

**To add this library to your project, add** `#require "promise.class.nut:3.0.1"` **to the top of your agent and/or device code.**

## Class Usage

### Constructor: Promise(*actionFunction*)

The constructor should receive a single function, which will be executed to determine the final value and result. The function passed into *actionFunction* requires two parameters of its own, *resolve* and *reject*, both of which are themselves function references. Exactly one of these functions should be executed at the completion of the *actionFunction*.

- `function resolve([value])` &mdash; calling *resolve()* sets Promise state as resolved and calls success handlers (passed as first argument of *.then()*)
- `function reject([reason])` &mdash; calling *reject()* sets Promise state as rejected and calls *.fail()* handlers

```squirrel
#require "promise.class.nut:3.0.1"

myPromise <- Promise(myActionFunction);
```

## Instance Methods

### then(*[onFulfilled, onRejected]*)

The *then()* method allows the developer to provide an *onFulfilled* function and/or an *onRejected* function. Default handlers will be used if no parameters are passed in. **Note** to pass in an *onRejected* function only, you must pass in `null` as the first parameter and the *onRejected* function as the second parameter.

This method returns a *Promise* object to allow for method chaining.

```squirrel
myPromise
    .then(function(value) {
        server.log("myPromise resolved with value: " + value);
    }, function(reason) {
        server.log("myPromise rejected for reason: " + reason);
    });
```

Promises which reject with reasons will have their *onRejected* handlers called with that reason. Promises which resolve with values will have their *onFulfilled* handler called with that value. Calls to *then()* return promises, so a handler function (either *onFulfilled* or *onRejected*) registered in *then()* which returns a value will pass this value on to the next *onFulfilled* handler in the chain, and any exceptions throw by a handler will be passed on to the next available *onRejected* handler. In this way errors can be caught and handled or thrown again, much like with Squirrel’s `try` and `catch`. The following example is for demonstration only and is overly verbose.

```squirrel
// 'name' is a variable that *should* contain a string, but may not be

Promise.resolve(name)
    .then(function(name) {
        if (typeof name != "string") {
            throw "Invalid name";
        } else {
            // 'name' is valid, so just pass it through
            return name;
        }
    }, null)

    .then(null, function(reason) {
        // I run with reason == "invalid name"
        // So handle invalid name by providing a default
        return "Bob";
    })

    .then(function(name) {
        // I have a valid name
    });
```

Passing `null` as a handler corresponds to the default behaviour of passing any values through to the next available *onFulfilled* handler, or throwing exceptions throwing to the next available *onRejected* handler.

**Note** Just as if no *onFulfilled* handlers are registered the last value returned will be ignored, if no *onRejected* handlers are registered any exceptions that occur within a promise executor or handler function will **not** be caught and will be silently ignored. Thus it is prudent to always add the following line at the end of your promise chains:

```squirrel
.fail(server.error.bindenv(server));
```

### fail(*onRejected*)

The *fail()* method allows the developer to provide an *onRejection* function. This call is quivalent to `.then(null, onRejected)`.

```squirrel
myPromise
    .then(successHandler)
    .fail(function(reason) {
        server.log("myPromise rejected for reason OR successHandler through exception: " + reason);
    });
```

### finally(*alwaysFunction*)

The *finally()* method allows the developer to provide a function that is executed both on resolve and rejection (ie. when the promise is *settled*). This call is quivalent to `.then(alwaysFunction, alwaysFunction)`. The *alwaysFunction* accepts one prameter: result or error.

```squirrel
myPromise
    .finally(function(valueOrReason) {
        server.log("myPromise resolved or rejected with value or reason: " +  valueOrReason);
    });
```

## Class Methods

### Promise.resolve(*value*)

This method returns a promise that immediately resolves to a given value.

```squirrel
Promise.resolve(value)
    .then(function(value) {
        // Operate on value
    });
```

### Promise.reject(*reason*)

This method returns a promise that immediately rejects with a given reason.

```squirrel
Promise.reject(reason)
    .fail(function(reason) {
        // Operate on reason
    });
```

### Promise.all(*series*)

This method executes promises in parallel and resolves when they are all done. It Returns a promise that resolves with an array of the resolved promise value or rejects with first rejected paralleled promise value.

The parameter *series* is an array of promises and/or functions that return promises.

For example, in the following code *p* resolves with value `[1, 2, 3]` in 1.5 seconds:

```squirrel
local series = [
    @() Promise(@(resolve, reject) imp.wakeup(1, @() resolve(1))),
    @() Promise(@(resolve, reject) imp.wakeup(1.5, @() resolve(2))),
    Promise(@(resolve, reject) imp.wakeup(0.5, @() resolve(3)))
];

local p = Promise.all(series);
p.then(function(values) {
        // values == [1, 2, 3]
    });
```

### Promise.race(*series*)

This method executes promises in parallel and resolves when the first is done. It returns a promise that resolves or rejects with the first resolved/rejected promise value.

The parameter *series* is an array of promises and/or functions that return promises.

For example, in the following code *p* rejects with value `"1"` in 1 second:

```squirrel
local promises = [
    // rejects first as the other one with 1s timeout
    // starts later from inside .race()
    Promise(function (resolve, reject) { imp.wakeup(1, @() reject(1)) }),
    @() Promise(function (resolve, reject) { imp.wakeup(1.5, @() resolve(2)) }),
    @() Promise(function (resolve, reject) { imp.wakeup(1, @() reject(3)) }),
];

local p = Promise.race(promises);
p.then(function(value) {
        // Not run
    }, function(reason) {
        // reason == 1
    });
```

### Promise.loop(*continueFunction, nextFunction*)

This method provides a way to perform `while` loops with asynchronous processes. It takes the following parameters:

- *continueFunction* &mdash; a function that returns `true` to continue the loop or `false` to stop it
- *nextFunction* &mdash; a function that returns next promise in the loop

The loop stops on `continueFunction() == false` or first rejection of looped promises.

*loop()* returns a promise that is resolved/rejected with the last value that comes from the looped promise when the loop finishes.

For example, in the following code *p* resolves with value `"counter is 3"` in 9 seconds.

```squirrel
local i = 0;
local p = Promise.loop(
    @() i++ < 3,
    function () {
        return Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
            imp.wakeup(3, function() {
                resolve("Counter is " + i);
            });
        });
    });
```

### Promise.serial(*series*)

This method returns a promise that resolves when all the promises in the chain resolve or when the first one rejects.

The parameter *series* is an array of promises and/or functions that return promises.

For example, in the following code *p* rejects with value `"2"` in 2.5 seconds:

```squirrel
local series = [
    Promise(@(resolve, reject) imp.wakeup(1, @() resolve(1))),
    @() Promise(@(resolve, reject) imp.wakeup(1.5, @() reject(2))),
    Promise(@(resolve, reject) imp.wakeup(0.5, @() resolve(3)))
];

local p = Promise.serial(series);
```

## Testing

Repository contains [impUnit](https://github.com/electricimp/impUnit) tests and a configuration for [impTest](https://github.com/electricimp/impTest) tool.

### TL;DR

```bash
cp .imptest .imptest-local
nano .imptest-local # edit device/model
imptest test -c .imptest-local
```

### Running Tests

Tests can be launched with:

```bash
imptest test
```

By default configuration for the testing is read from [.imptest](https://github.com/electricimp/impTest/blob/develop/docs/imptest-spec.md).

To run test with your settings (for example while you are developing), create your copy of **.imptest** file and name it something like **.imptest.local**, then run tests with:

 ```bash
 imptest test -c .imptest.local
 ```

Tests will run with any imp.
